            The Mush Problem

            <p>Regardless of cooking method, squash inevitably becomes an indeterminate mush. Roasted? Mushy.
            Steamed? Mushier. Microwaved? You monster. And don't even get started on how it disintegrates
            into sad orange puddles when overcooked by even 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>Spaghetti squash earns special dishonor here. Those strings aren't pasta. They're not even
            pasta-adjacent. They're wet, flavorless fibers that somehow manage to be both watery and dry
            simultaneously - a feat previously thought impossible in food science.</p>

            The Waterlogged Effect
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>Squash has an uncanny ability to be 90% water while still managing to have a dry, mealy mouthfeel.
            It's the worst of both worlds - soggy AND chalky. This defies physics and good taste.</p>

            <p class="text-sm">Squash has the flavor profile of wet paper towels. Any taste you detect is coming from
            the butter, brown sugar, or existential despair you've added to make it palatable.</p>

              Squash soup. Squash ravioli. Squash risotto. Squash pizza. As if adding it to pasta will

          <p class="text-sm">Squash fails on texture, flavor, cultural relevance, and practicality. It wastes time,
          ruins meals, and occupies valuable real estate on dinner plates that could go to literally any other
          vegetable. The prosecution rests.</p>
