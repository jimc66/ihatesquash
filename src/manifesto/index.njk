      A Declaration of Culinary Independence

          When in the course of culinary events, it becomes necessary for people to dissolve the bands
          which have connected them with squash, and to assume among the vegetables of the earth, the
          separate and equal station to which honest flavor entitles them, a decent respect to the
          opinions of taste buds requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

          <span class="text-2xl">📜</span>

          <span class="text-2xl">📜</span>

          pursuit of vegetables that don't disappoint.</p>

          <span class="text-2xl">📜</span>
          <p>That when any vegetable becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of diners

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Our Grievances</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The history of squash is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
        object the establishment of absolute tyranny over autumn menus. To prove this, let facts be
        submitted to a candid world:
      </p>

      <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li>Squash has refused assent to flavor, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
        <li>It has dissolved representative texture repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness its
        invasions on the rights of decent mouthfeel.</li>
        <li>It has endeavored to prevent the population of good vegetables on dinner plates, obstructing
        the space for broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and other worthy contenders.</li>
        <li>It has made judges dependent on its will alone for the tenure of their approval at potlucks,
        forcing polite lies like "oh, it's interesting."</li>
        <li>It has erected a multitude of new recipes and sent forth swarms of food bloggers to harass
        our feeds with 47 variations of butternut squash soup.</li>
        <li>It has combined with farmers markets to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our
        taste preferences, giving assent to acts of pretended nutrition.</li>
        <li>For imposing bland mushiness on us without our consent.</li>
        <li>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of actual comfort food.</li>
        <li>For transporting squash across state lines to be inflicted upon innocent restaurant menus.</li>
        <li>For taking away our appetite, abolishing our most valuable enjoyment of meals, and altering
        fundamentally the character of fall dining.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">We Therefore Declare</h2>

      <div class="bg-primary text-primary-content p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We, therefore, the representatives of squash-haters everywhere, appealing to the supreme
          judge of taste for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority
          of discerning palates everywhere, solemnly publish and declare:
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl font-bold text-center">
          That we are, and of right ought to be, free and independent from squash obligations.

          This manifesto is not a call for violence against squash (that would be wasteful - it's already
          dead). Rather, it is a call for honesty. A call for courage. A call to stop nodding politely
          when someone says "I made butternut squash lasagna!"

          Stand with us. Speak your truth. Say no to squash.
